I am a Master Degree student in Applied Economics turning to Data science. My Bachelor in Economics equipped me with solid groundings in Math, Statistics, Econometrics and Economic reasoning (both micro and macro economics).

I'm turning to Data science because I love taking challenges that let me grow and solving business problems with data is something I really want to do.

I strive for continuous progress in everything I do. I do not settle on titles or diplomas but I am skills-and-solutions oriented and so am enthousiast to work in an environment which encourages me to succeed and grow professionally where I can use my skills and knowledge appropriately.

I am open to all propositions related to Data science whether it is for an internship or job offers.
I'm proficient with R programming and with the tidyverse ecosystems for Data science. I am now focusing on transfering these skills to Python so to be fluent with both languages.
